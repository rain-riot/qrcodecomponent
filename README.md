## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I use flexbox for this simple QR code. It's good start for me because i'm a newbie in this world.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<img class="qrcode" src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="" />
```

```css
.qrcode {
  justify-content: top;
  align-items: center;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin-top: 5%;
  width: 90%;
  height: 70%;
  border-radius: 15px;
  margin-left: 5%;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I hope i can pass the next challange, while learning everything like Javascript or even React.JS
